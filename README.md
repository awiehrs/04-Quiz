Homework - Week 4: JavaScript Quiz

## Description

The assignment this week was to create a functional quiz using vanilla JavaScript.
The inspiration for this project comes from my interest in honeybees and their fascinating lives. The goal is for the user to test their existing knowledge and perhaps learn something new, and compare to others who take the quiz.
